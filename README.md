# Developing a Modular React Admin Dashboard Using WordPress as a Headless CMS

When I began my journey as a web developer many years ago, the thought of creating custom administrative interfaces seemed like a daunting challenge. Crafting modular, reusable components appeared to be an advanced skill reserved for seasoned engineers working at prominent agencies.

Fast forward to today, and as a frontend developer at [Hybrid Web Agency](https://hybridwebagency.com/), I've had the privilege of working on various headless CMS-powered admin dashboards using React. The progress made in frameworks and tooling has made what was once considered unattainable now within reach for developers of all levels.

One observation I've made is that while many tutorials cover the fundamentals of setting up a React app to consume WordPress data, they often lack guidance on building reusable, future-proof solutions. They also fall short of providing best practices for code organization, state management, and scalability over time.

Having faced these challenges firsthand on client projects at Hybrid, I'm excited to share a comprehensive tutorial on building a fully-fledged modular admin dashboard interface. The approach I'll present focuses on the separation of presentational and container components, the implementation of custom hooks for data handling and side effects, and the establishment of a robust foundation for seamlessly adding new admin modules later.

Instead of merely connecting to a REST API, my aim is to equip you with the knowledge of how to construct an admin application using best practices in terms of scalability, maintainability, and extensibility. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a deep understanding of practical techniques for structuring modular React applications powered by WordPress as a CMSâ€”without the need for guesswork or reinventing the wheel with each new feature.

## Setting Up WordPress as a Headless CMS

The first step is to install WordPress. You can either download and extract the files to your local development environment or deploy WordPress on a hosting service. For this tutorial, I'll be using MAMP on my local machine.

Once WordPress is installed, it's essential to enable the REST API functionality. This feature allows frontend applications to interact with WordPress data through RESTful endpoints. To enable it, navigate to Plugins > Add New and search for "REST API." Install and activate the REST API plugin.

Next, we need to set the core API permissions by adding the following code to our theme's `functions.php` file:

```php
function make_rest_request_allow_any() {
  remove_filter('rest_pre_serve_request', 'rest_send_cors_headers');
}
add_action('rest_api_init', 'make_rest_request_allow_any');
```

This code permits requests from any domain, which is particularly important during development when our React app resides on a different origin.

The subsequent step is to register custom post types so that our React app can retrieve and manage specialized content types beyond the default WordPress post and page types. We'll create a custom post type called "Projects" by using the following code:

```php
function create_project_post_type() {

  register_post_type( 'project',
    array(
      'labels' => array(
        'name' => __( 'Projects' ),
      ),
    )
  );

}
add_action( 'init', 'create_project_post_type' );
```

### Building the React Admin App

To kickstart our React app, run the following command in your command line:

```bash
npx create-react-app admin-app
```

This command sets up the foundation for our React project.

Our first component, Posts.js, will be responsible for fetching and displaying post data from WordPress. We'll import the `useEffect` hook and make a GET request to the `/wp-json/wp/v2/posts` endpoint:

```jsx
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function Posts() {

  const [posts, setPosts] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/wp-json/wp/v2/posts')
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => setPosts(data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {posts.map(post => (
        <Post key={post.id} post={post} />
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

This provides the basics of setting up WordPress as a headless CMS and rendering its data in our React interface. In the upcoming sections, we'll incorporate functionalities for creating/updating posts and implementing routing.

### Fetching Posts Data

The `useEffect` hook enables us to fetch data from the API upon component mounting. We import `useEffect` and define state variables for the posts array and a loading state:

```js
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function Posts() {

  const [posts, setPosts] = useState([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    // API call 
  }, [])
}
```

Within the `useEffect`, we make a GET request to the WordPress REST API posts endpoint. Once the response is received, we parse the JSON data and store it in the state. This update causes the component to re-render with the newly fetched data.

```js
fetch('/wp-json/wp/v2/posts')
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => {
    setPosts(data);
    setLoading(false);
  });
```

### Displaying Posts

With the posts data in hand, we can proceed to display it. We'll create a `Post` component to render each individual post. This component accepts the post as a prop and destructures the relevant fields.

To enhance the overall layout and styling, we'll use Material UI grid, cards, and typography components

. This approach leads to a cleaner and more organized user interface. Inside `Posts.js`, we map over the posts state array and render a `Post` component for each post. This results in an attractive grid layout for displaying the post title, excerpt, and other fields.

### Adding Posts 

For the form used to add posts, we'll utilize the `useState` hook to keep track of the input values and errors in the state. We define an initial state object and setter functions. 

A Formik wrapper handles validation and submission. Upon submission, it triggers a `handleSubmit` function that initiates the API request to create a new post. 

We'll also implement error handling to display errors in case the API request fails. This approach enhances the user experience compared to generic alerts.

### Routing and Layout

We can leverage React Router to define routes and navigation for our single-page application. By initializing Router and adding Route paths for the main pages, we can manage the UI elements more efficiently. Common elements such as headers are extracted into reusable `Header.js` and `Sidebar.js` components. These elements are rendered on every route by using `props.children`.

Additionally, we can conditionally display button links for adding new posts and navigating between sections using the React Router Link component. This interconnects all the components into a polished admin interface.

## Embracing Modularity

Now that we've established the fundamentals of fetching, displaying, and managing posts, it's time to enhance our code's modularity and reusability. This entails extracting shared logic and user interface elements into custom hooks and components.

A good starting point is the data-fetching logic. Currently, we have `useEffect` calls directly within our `Posts` component, but this logic can be abstracted. Let's create a `useApiData` hook to handle GET requests and return the data:

```js
function useApiData(endpoint) {

  const [data, setData] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(endpoint)
      .then(res => res.json()) 
      .then(setData);
  }, [endpoint]);

  return data;

}
```

Now, within `Posts`, we simply call the hook and tidy up the component code:

```js 
function Posts() {

  const posts = useApiData('/posts');

  return (
    <PostList posts={posts} />
  );

}
```

This shift makes our data-fetching logic reusable across other components.

As we expand the admin's feature set, we can segment sections into logical feature modules that encapsulate related user interface and logic entirely. Let's introduce a profiles section for managing site users. We'll create a `Profiles` module with its own route and reuse the data hook:

```js
function Profiles() {

  const profiles = useApiData('/profiles');

  return (
    <ProfileList profiles={profiles} />
  );

}
```

By constructing modular, reusable components, our code becomes more organized and easier to maintain as we introduce new features. Common utilities like hooks prevent code duplication throughout the application. This structure also ensures that our admin interface is highly customizable, enabling the inclusion or exclusion of modules based on specific requirements. Additional sections, such as settings, can follow the same pattern.

In summary, by prioritizing modularity and the separation of concerns, we ensure that the admin dashboard scales gracefully as requirements evolve over time, even in Chandler at our hybrid agency.

## Wrapping Up

In this tutorial, we've delved into the architecture of a modular React admin dashboard powered by WordPress as a headless CMS. By decoupling the frontend from the backend, adhering to best practices in component structure and reusable logic, and emphasizing modularity, we've established a strong foundation for continuous improvement of the admin interface.

While the fundamentals of rendering and managing WordPress content are straightforward, the true value lies in building solutions that stand the test of time. By developing applications using techniques like custom hooks, feature modules, and the separation of concerns, websites can evolve in a maintainable way without the need for extensive refactoring.

This approach holds particular importance for organizations like us at Hybrid Web Agency, which provides customized [WordPress development services in Chandler](https://hybridwebagency.com/chandler-az/custom-wordpress-development-services/).
